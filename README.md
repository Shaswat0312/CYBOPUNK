**CYBOPUNK** is a neon-lit, cyberpunk-themed quiz web app built to make learning cybersecurity concepts fun, fast, and a little futuristic.

Built with React and Tailwind CSS, this app challenges users with random security questions, styled in a glowing digital interface that feels like a mini-game, not a classroom.
